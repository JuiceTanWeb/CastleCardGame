# CastleCardGame
The computer version of castle, a popular card game.
Your opponent and you get 7 cards each, along with a 3 card castle you cannot see. 
The card ranks, from least to greatest, is 3,4,5,6,7,8,9,j,q,k,a, and 2. You can put a card greater or equal in value to the center card.
If you do not have a card to put down, you have to continue drawing until you do have a card.
10 is a special card that resets the center and allows you to place down another card.
Once you empty your hand, you have to draw from the castles. If the castle rank is higher than the center rank, you are safe.
However, if your castle rank is lower than the center rank, you have to take the center cards. 
You play until all your cards are gone.
THIS GAME IS STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS. SOME FEATURES ARE NOT AVAILABLE YET.
